TBA.
API is still a WIP and my vision has changed multiple times but I'm almost at a point where I'd be
comfortable using it in production. Will have official documentation ready for when that time comes.
Till then you can get a good idea of how the library will work by looking over the tests. if you're
curious. The goal is still to center everything and that's exactly what the ChannelCluster class
will specialize in. That will be the main focus as soon as I finish the public API for Back/Front Channels
and the Client.
